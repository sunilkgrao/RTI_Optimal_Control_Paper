Dear Shenguang-II Data Access Team,

We are conducting a validation study of Rayleigh-Taylor instability control theories 
and request access to experimental data with the following parameters:

Required Data:
- Shot numbers: Recent shots from 2020-2024
- Atwood numbers: Range 0.1-0.9
- Diagnostics: Growth rate measurements, mixing width evolution
- Time resolution: Sub-microsecond preferred
- Wavelength range: 20-72 Î¼m perturbations

Purpose: Academic validation of theoretical predictions published in [paper reference]

Data will be used for:
1. Validation of universal collapse theorem
2. Bang-bang control verification
3. Edge-of-transparency tracking analysis

We will acknowledge Shenguang-II in any resulting publications.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Research Team]
